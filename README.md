unity-chess
===========

This is a very basic chess program started so I can learn Unity and C# on the side. Commits will consist
solely of code assets; any meshes or textures in the final version will be from the unity store, so they 
will not be uploaded.

The project is in its initial stages. Much remains to be implemented, and existing code will likely be 
replaced with more elegant solutions later on.

Once the game is in a more workable state, I will look into hosting and linking a functional version as
a unity player download.

Changelog:
  v0.01 : 5/12/14 - Initial commit. Rough draft of adjacency and movement implemented: kings can be added
to the board and can be selected/moved around. No implementation of game rules (win cons, turns, etc.)
yet. Next step will be defining additional kinds of game pieces.
